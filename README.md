## Analysis Of Coronavirus using Spread SIR Model of Prediction
This is an attempt to data model and analyse the Coronavirus (COVID-19) spread with the help of Python. This analysis will help us find the basis behind common notions about the virus spread from purely a dataset perspective. I have used to SIR(Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) Prediction Model to train the data and make the predictions.

Inorder to see the predicted model download the iPython notebook and run the Learner class object and use the graphs to compare between the predicted cases and the actual number of cases.
