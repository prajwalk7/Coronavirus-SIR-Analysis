## Analysis Of Coronavirus using Spread SIR Model of Prediction
This is an attempt to data model and analyse the Coronavirus (COVID-19) spread with the help of Python. This analysis will help us find the basis behind common notions about the virus spread from purely a dataset perspective. I have used to SIR(Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) Prediction Model to train the data and make the predictions.
